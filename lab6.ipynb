I'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  I don't\\n>have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information:\\n>\\n>[...]  Any stories on how you all learned?\\n\\nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\\n\\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\\n\\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\\nI also passed my road test.\\n\\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\\na car and been killed.\\n\\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\\nas I did.\\n\\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\\nyou're ready to use it.\\n\\n>1)  I only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have \\n>to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that I'm too \\n>ignorant to know I need to buy)\\n\\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n>2)  What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  I turn 18 in \\n>about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up\\n>till now, and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a \\n>motorcycle is going to insure (I live in Washington DC if that makes\\n>a difference)\\n\\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\\nmore expensive.\\n\\n>3)  Any recommendations on what I should buy/where I should look for it?\\n\\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\\n\\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.\\n\\n-- David Karr (karr@cs.cornell.edu)\\n-- '80 BMW R65   DoD #0969   also BMWMOA, NRA, ACLU, et al.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Thus, any claimed\\n\\'truth\\' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn\\'t to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage \\'means\\' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal\\'s Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don\\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal\\'s Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\\'s version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you\\'re believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one\\'s eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one\\'s interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\\'s wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam\\'s Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam\\'s Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam\\'s \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam\\'s Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam\\'s Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn\\'t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it\\'s good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you\\'re cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein\\'s\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein\\'s religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\nit he says:\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\nEinstein has also said:\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it\\'s money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists\\' reactions to (for\\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists\\'.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\\nno smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\\ndon\\'t think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can\\'t have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn\\'t assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus\\'s work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as \\'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.\\' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.

(Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn\\'t tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel\\'s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988.

As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in \\nthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is \\nat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best\\nguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second\\nmarker?  \\n\\nAnyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape\\nis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The\\ntape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where\\nthe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the \\nlight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty\\nor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have\\na problem detecting the end of the tape.\\n\\nIf the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either\\nthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open\\nthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head\\nassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may\\nneed to be serviced.

(\\'Nuff said)\\n\\t- We get *GOOD* traction.  We\\'re not going to fall over.  (Many\\n\\t  first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn!)\\n\\t- Turn dynamics:  sit so that you feel like you\\'re sitting upright and\\n\\t  we\\'re going straight.  Trust your butt, not your eyes -- if you\\'re\\n\\t  confused, close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel\\n\\t  of it.  Or just hug me tight.  \\n\\t- Please, no sudden moves -- shift your weight as desired, but be \\n\\t  gradual, so I can compensate.\\n\\t- Your faceplate is yours to open/close as desired.\\n\\t- Trust is essential.  Trust the driver (me) to do the right \\n\\t  thing -- I\\'ve driven many miles on this thing, and know how\\n\\t  to operate it.  Enjoy the ride.  (This is important to\\n\\t  stress.  For example, one of my first-time passwngers seemed to \\n\\t  watch the speedo like a hawk:  I drove her to the beach down 84, \\n\\t  and whever we topped 35 mph, she\\'d holler, \"SLOW DOWN!

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

Thus you achieve your\\naim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note\\nthat this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since\\nyou have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left\\nonce you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.\\n\\nA sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus\\na mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use\\nthe fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the\\nfour enable lines.\\n\\nOf course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the\\nfour final stage decoders.\\n\\nPlease give me the credit when you submit your homework.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\",\n",

Also,\\n   don\\'t be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,\\n   resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,\\n   magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).\\n\\nNOTES:\\n\\n   to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area\\n   where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole\\n   particles only exist in the presence of matter.\\n   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain\\n   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if\\n   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point\\n   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).\\n   I don\\'t want a theoretical discussion here about whether\\n   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for\\n   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such\\n   currents *if* they exist.\\n   Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics\\n   since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.\\n\\nThanx,\\nEric.\\n\\n----\\n ET   \"A Force of Nature\"\\n----\\n',\n",

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\\n\\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don\\'t think that I have come to\\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven\\'t come to bring peace,\\n       but rather a sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\\nedition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\\nmakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\\n\\nJ. L. MACKIE\\n\\n\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\\nThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\\narguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\\nformalistic and better written than Martin\\'s works, and refreshingly direct\\nwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\\n\\nJAMES A.

The scenario you outline is reasonably \\nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we\\'ve been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n>                             God created the original genetic code\\n>perfect and without flaw.

Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn\\'t do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants \\'overgrazed\\',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I\\'m an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer.

I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who\\'s making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n>This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you\\n>are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease.\\n>Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of\\n>disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since\\n>humanity forsook God\\'s protection.\\n\\n Here\\'s another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by \\'perfect\\' in the\\nphrase, \\'created... perfect and without flaw\\'? To my mind, a \\'perfect\\'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A \\'perfect\\' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer\\'s glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic \\'instructions\\' were perfect, but were \\'written\\' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n>In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn\\'t any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

Currently I have  \\n8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.  \\nboth banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinking  \\nof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I know  \\nthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution I  \\ncan see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about  \\n$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,  \\nthe entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means that  \\nthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would rather  \\navoid...\\n\\nSo my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot work  \\nwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about  \\n$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, how  \\ndo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup the  \\nextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that the  \\nISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, so  \\nprobably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is truly  \\nappreciated.\\n\\n-Eric\\n\\nebosco@us.oracle.com\\n\\n\",\n",

Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how they\\ndesign for shock waves.\\n\\n\\t<================================================>\\n       /        Rich Sturges           (h) 703-536-4443   \\\\\\n      /    NSWC - Carderock Division   (w) 301-227-1670    \\\\\\n     /  \"I speak for no one else, and listen to the same.\"  \\\\\\n    <========================================================>\\n',\n",

Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\\n\\tclear choice when speed is not important.\\n\\n74HC\\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\\n\\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\\n\\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\\n\\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\\n\\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\\n\\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\\n\\n10K\\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\\n\\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\\n\\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\\n\\tthe rules or it won\\'t work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\\n\\tcan be expensive.\\n\\n100K\\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\\n\\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\\n\\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\\ninteresting but I haven\\'t used either significantly yet.\\n-- \\nAll work is one man\\'s work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\\n',\n",

If you\\'re feeling\\ncreative, and your favorite number hasn\\'t been taken already, you can\\nmake a request, subject to KotL approval. (Warning, non-numeric, non-\\nbase-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the KotL. Not\\nthat you won\\'t get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)\\n\\nOh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. Ask the KotL in e-mail. You\\'ll\\njust be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole\\nnet, and you\\'ll look like a clueless newbie too.\\n\\nBy now you\\'re probably asking \"So who\\'s the KotL already?\". Well, as\\nJohn Sloan notes below, that\\'s about the only real \"secret\" left around\\nhere, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. First, it is not myself,\\nnor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though John was\\nthe original KotL. Second, in keeping with the true spirit of Unix, the\\nKotL\\'s first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely\\nwith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the KotL shares his name with a line-\\noriented text utility.) Third, he has occasionally been seen posting\\nmessages bestowing new DoD numbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weenie\\nmailers\"). Fourth, there is reason to suspect the KotL of being a\\nDead-Head.\\n\\n***************** Newsflash: A message from the KotL ******************\\n\\nOnce you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically\\ngroveled to the KotL, please keep in mind that the KotL does indeed\\nwork for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting\\nsomething done.  Your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)\\ndays, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  During such times of\\neconomic activity on the part of the KotL\\'s employers, sending yet\\nanother copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it\\njust makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an\\nexcersize for the reader).  If you suspect mailer problems, at least\\nannotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request\\nwas submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think\\nthe KotL *memorizes* the list?!?).\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n\\nOne more thing, the KotL says that its telepathic powers aren\\'t what\\nthey used to be.

They discuss motorcycles and  \\nmotorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  \\nhelmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve\\nseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, \\ntraffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double \\nentendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  They \\nargue with each other and plan rides together.\\n\\nThe difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, \\nalthough they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each \\nother face to face.  The members of this group live all over the known world \\nand communicate with each other electronically via computer.\\n\\nThe computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  \\nthe people range from college and university students to high-tech industry \\nprofessionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  Currently, \\nrec.motorcycles (pronounced \"wreck-dot-motorcycles,\" it\\'s the file name for \\nthe group\\'s primary on-line \"meeting place\") carries about 2250 articles per \\nmonth;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  Most of the frequent \\nposters belong to a motorcycle club, the Denizens of Doom, usually referred \\nto as the DoD.\\n\\nThe DoD started when motorcyclist John R. Nickerson wrote a couple of \\nparodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  Fellow computer \\nenthusiast Bruce Robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"Denizen \\nof Doom.\"  A while later Chuck Rogers signed off as DoD nr. 0003 Keeper of \\nthe Flame.  Bruce was then designated DoD nr. 0002, retroactively and, of \\ncourse, Nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given DoD nr. 0001.\\n\\nThe idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules \\nappealed to many, so John Sloan -- DoD nr. 0011 -- became Keeper of the \\nList, issuing DoD numbers to anyone who wanted one.  To date there have been \\nalmost 400 memberships issued to people all over the United States and \\nCanada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Norway and Finland.\\n\\nKeeper of the List Sloan eventually designed a club patch.  The initial run \\nof 300 patches sold out immediately.  The profits from this went to the \\nAmerican Motorcycle Heritage Foundation.  Another AMHF fund raiser -- \\nselling Denizens of Doom pins to members -- was started by Arnie Skurow a \\nfew months later.  Again, the project was successful and the profits were \\ndonated to the foundation.  So far, the Denizens have contributed over $1500 \\nto the AMA museum.  A plaque in the name of the Denizens of Doom now hangs \\nin the Motorcycle Heritage Museum.\\n\\nAs often as possible, the DoD\\'ers crawl out from behind their CRTs and go \\nriding together.  It turns out that the two largest concentrations of \\nDoD\\'ers are centered near Denver/Boulder, Colorado, and in California\\'s \\n\"Silicon Valley.\"  Consequently, two major events are the annual Assault on \\nRollins Pass in Colorado, and the Northern versus Southern California \\n\"Joust.\"\\n\\nThe Ride-and-Feed is a bike trip over Rollins Pass, followed by a big \\nbarbecue dinner.  The concept for the Joust is to have riders from Northern \\nCalifornia ride south; riders from Southern California to ride north, \\nmeeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  An additional plan \\nfor 1991 is to hold an official Denizens of Doom homecoming in conjunction \\nwith the AMA heritage homecoming in Columbus, Ohio, in July.\\n\\nThough it\\'s a safe bet the the Denizens of Doom and their collective \\ncommunications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional \\nmotorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in \\nsearch of two-wheeled camaraderie, it\\'s a great way for kindred spirits to \\nget together.  Long may they flame.\\n\\n\\n\"Live to Flame -- Flame to Live\"\\t[centerbar]\\n\\nThis official motto of the Denizens of Doom refers to the ease with which \\nyou can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do \\nanything like that face to face.  These insults are known as \"flames\";  \\nissuing them is called \"flaming.\"  Flames often start when a member \\ndisagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  A \\ntypical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be \\nsomething like:  \"What an incredibly stupid statement, you Spandex-clad \\nposeur!\"  This will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense \\nof the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding \\nability and your cat.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n          _The Denizens of Doom: The Saga Unfolds_\\n\\n                  by John Sloan  DoD #0011\\n\\nPeriodically the question \"What is DoD?\" is raised. This is one of\\nthose questions in the same class as \"Why is the sky blue?\", \"If there\\nis a God, why is there so much suffering in the world?\" and \"Why do\\nwomen inevitably tell you that you\\'re such a nice guy just before they\\ndump you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,\\nand philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion\\nby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the\\nhalls of academe for generations. \\n\\nA long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few\\nminutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on\\na computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two\\nmachines in the same room in Atlanta might route mail to one another\\nvia a system in Chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but\\nwho was eventually assigned the DoD membership #1) wrote a satire of\\nthe various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and\\nsigned it \"The Denizen of Doom\". Not wishing to identify himself, he\\nasked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time\\nbecome DoD #2 to post it for him. DoD #2, not really giving a whit\\nabout what other people thought and generally being a right thinking\\nindividual, did so.  Flaming and other amusements followed. \\n\\nHe who would become the holder of DoD membership #3 thought this was\\nthe funniest thing he\\'d seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty\\neasily amused), so he claimed membership in the Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club, and started signing his postings with his membership\\nnumber. \\n\\nPerhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a\\nmotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or\\nmake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized\\nelectronically.  It may well be that readers were yearning to become a\\npart of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a\\ngestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the\\nsum of its parts.  It could also be that we\\'re all computer nerds who\\nwear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen\\nto also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight\\nratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open\\nminded enough to accept us as members. \\n\\nIn a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, The Denizens of Doom\\nMotorcycle Club was born. A club in which the majority of members have\\nnever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet\\nfeel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some\\nof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). A club organized\\nand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the\\nnetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list\\n(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the\\nsame region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating\\naround the country (organized by DoD #9), club patches (organized by\\n#11), and even an MTV-style music video (produced by #47 and\\ndistributed on VHS by #18)! \\n\\nWhere will it end? Who knows? Will the DoD start sanctioning races,\\nplacing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine\\nmanagement computers? Will the DoD organize poker runs where each\\nparticipant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?\\nWill the DoD have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal\\nroom and at least a 386-sized UNIX system? Only time will tell. \\n\\nThe DoD has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net\\naccess and a love for motorcycles. To become a member, one need only\\nask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few\\nreally good club secrets). New members will receive via email a\\nmembership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which\\nincludes name, state, and email address. \\n\\nThe Denizens of Doom Motorcycle Club will live forever (or at least\\nuntil next year when we may decided to change the name). \\n\\n                  Live to Flame - Flame to Live\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n     The DoD daemon as seen on the patches, pins, etc. by\\n\\n\\tChuck Rogers,  car377@druhi.att.com,  DoD #0003\\n \\n\\n                :-(           DoD            )-: \\n               :-(  x    __         __    x   )-:      \\n              :-(  x    / /         \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:     \\n             :-(  x    / / -\\\\-----/- \\\\ \\\\    x   )-:    \\n            :-(  L     | \\\\/  \\\\   /  \\\\/ |     F   )-:   \\n            :-(  I     | /    \\\\ /    \\\\ |     L   )-:   \\n            :-(  V     \\\\/ __   /   __ \\\\/     A   )-:   \\n            :-(  E     / /  \\\\     /  \\\\ \\\\     M   )-:   \\n            :-(        | |   \\\\   /   | |     E   )-:   \\n            :-(  T     | | . | _ | . | |         )-:   \\n            :-(  O     | \\\\___// \\\\\\\\___/ |     T   )-:   \\n            :-(         \\\\     \\\\_/     /      O   )-:   \\n            :-(  F       \\\\___     ___/           )-:   \\n            :-(  L        \\\\ \\\\     / /        L   )-:   \\n            :-(  A         \\\\ vvvvv /         I   )-:   \\n            :-(  M         | (   ) |         V   )-:   \\n            :-(  E         | ^^^^^ |         E   )-:   \\n             :-(  x        \\\\_______/        x   )-:    \\n              :-(  x                       x   )-:     \\n               :-(  x   rec.motorcycles   x   )-:\\n                :-(          USENET          )-:\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      The DoD\\n\\n              by the Denizen of Doom    DoD #1\\n \\nWelcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of\\nall time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples?

And in the words of one Denizen, it intends to remain one.\\n\\nSometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: \"What does DoD\\nstand for? It\\'s not the Department of Defense is it?\" Naturally, a\\nDenizen who had watched the movie \"Top Gun\" a few times too many rose\\nto the occasion and replied:\\n\\n\"That\\'s classified, we could tell you, but then we\\'d have to kill you.\"\\n\\nAnd the rest is history.\\n\\nA variation on the \"security\" theme is to supply disinformation about\\nwhat DoD stands for. Notable contributions (and contributers, where\\nknown) include:\\n\\nDaughters of Democracy (DoD 23)\\t\\tDoers of Donuts\\nDancers of Despair (DoD 9)\\t\\tDebasers of Daughters\\nDickweeds of Denver\\t\\t\\tDriveway of Death\\nDebauchers of Donuts\\t\\t\\tDumpers of Dirtbikes\\n\\nNote that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be\\nlimited only by the contents of one\\'s imagination or dictionary file.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                     The rec.moto.photo archive\\n\\nFirst a bit of history, this all started with Ilana Stern and Chuck\\nRogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. Many copies were made,\\nand several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in\\nunknown locations. Then Bruce Tanner decided that it would be appropriate\\nfor an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. Bruce has not\\nonly provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken\\nthe time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.\\n\\nNot only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk\\nat their motorcycles. A few non-photo files are available from the\\nserver too, they include the DoD membership list, the DoD Yellow Pages,\\nthe general rec.motorcycles FAQ, and this FAQ posting.\\n\\nHere are a couple of excerpts from from messages Bruce posted about how\\nto use the archive.\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nVia ftp:\\n\\ncerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]\\n\\nVia e-mail:\\n\\nThe address is server@cerritos.edu.  The commands are given in the body of the\\nmessage.  The current commands are DIR and SEND, given one per line.  The\\narguments to the commands are VMS style file specifications.  For\\nrec.moto.photo the file spec is [DOD]file.  For example, you can send:\\n\\ndir [dod]\\nsend [dod]bruce_tanner.gif\\nsend [dod]dodframe.ps\\n\\nand you\\'ll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts\\nof bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ASCII.\\n\\nOh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to\\nthe next whole file) are send.  A \\'send [dod]*.gif\\' would send 150 files of\\n50K each; not a good idea.\\n-- \\nBruce Tanner        (213) 860-2451 x 596    Tanner@Cerritos.EDU\\nCerritos College    Norwalk, CA             cerritos!tanner\\n\\n**********************************************************\\n\\nA couple of comments: Bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so\\nwhy not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?\\nSecond, since Bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind\\nof you to access it after normal working hours (California time). \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                      Patches? What patches?\\n\\nYou may have heard mention of various DoD trinkets such as patches &\\npins. And your reaction was probably: \"I want!\", or \"That\\'s sick!\", or\\nperhaps \"That\\'s sick! I want!\"\\n\\nWell, there\\'s some good news and some bad news. The good news is that\\nthere\\'s been an amazing variety of DoD-labeled widgets created. The bad\\nnews is that there isn\\'t anywhere you can buy any of them. This isn\\'t\\nbecause of any \"exclusivity\" attempt, but simply because there is no\\n\"DoD store\" that keeps a stock. All of the creations have been done by\\nindividual Denizens out of their own pockets. The typical procedure is\\nsomeone says \"I\\'m thinking of having a DoD frammitz made, they\\'ll cost\\n$xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the AMA museum. Anyone want one?\" Then\\norders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the\\npre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). So if you want a\\nDoD doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. Or\\nproduce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all\\nthis is anarchy in action.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possibly incomplete list of known DoD merchandise (and\\nperpetrators). Patches (DoD#11), pins (DoD#99), stickers (DoD#99),\\nmotorcycle license plate frames (DoD#216), t-shirts (DoD#99), polo shirts\\n(DoD#122), Zippo lighters (DoD#99) [LtF FtL], belt buckles (DoD#99), and\\npatches (DoD#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by\\npopular demand].\\n\\nAll \"profits\" have been donated to the American Motorcyclist Association\\nMotorcycle Heritage Museum. As of June 1992, over $5500 dollars has been\\ncontributed to the museum fund by the DoD. If you visit the museum,\\nyou\\'ll see a large plaque on the Founders\\' Wall in the name of \"Denizens\\nof Doom, USENET, The World\", complete with a DoD pin.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a letter from the AMA to the DoD regarding our contributions.\\n\\n~Newsgroups: rec.motorcycles\\n~From: Arnie Skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>\\n~Subject: A letter from the Motorcycle Heritage Museum\\n~Date: Mon, 13 Apr 1992 11:04:58 GMT\\n\\nI received the following letter from Jim Rogers, director of the Museum,\\nthe other day.\\n\\n\"Dear Arnie and all members of the Denizens of Doom:\\n\\nCongratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the\\nDenizens of Doom!

Rides:\\n\\nSummer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the Joust in its third\\nyear, and the Ride & Feed going strong, but without the Rollins Pass\\ntrip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  The East Coast Denizens got\\ntogether for the Right Coast Ride (RCR), with bikers from as far north\\nas NH, and as far south as FL meeting in the Blueridge Mountains of\\nNorth Carolina.

It is very unlikely, however,\\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\\n\\nNot possible either.  You\\'d need about a 300 amp alternator for\\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\\n\\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \\n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \\n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \\n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\\n\\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\\n\\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \\ncause of your troubles,  and you\\'ll get better cooperation\\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \\n\\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\\nToo bad they don\\'t require the consumer equipment makers\\nto take any precautions.\\n\\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\\nCB\\'ers probably won\\'t sign (I don\\'t know that they\\'re even required\\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\nDouglas S.

These are equivalent \\nbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM \\ninterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).

Why you ask?  \\nSimple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit \\nCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data \\nfrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when \\nit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard \\nlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in \\nthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means \\nthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you \\nhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide \\ndata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks \\nare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data \\nwith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by \\none SIMM at a time.\\n\\nHope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your \\nquestion was not simple.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC\\n(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the\\nbundle (at least two of their sales people couldn\\'t give me a straight\\nanswer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).\\n\\nOther questions:\\n\\n- Excuse my ignorance, but is \"Texel\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM\\n  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?\\n\\n- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the\\n  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)\\n\\nAlternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my\\nuses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,\\neducational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end\\nTA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something\\nelse useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.\\n\\nBasically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED\\nthese kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably\\ndirectly to the email address below.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKoji\\n\\n                            2\\n                         _/\\n  ~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  |        _/        _/    |                  Koji Kodama                  |\\n  |  by   _/      _/       |              Nippon Motorola Ltd.             |\\n  |      _/    _/          |            ryvg90@email.sps.mot.com           |\\n  |     _/  _/             |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\\n  |    _/_/  _/            |      NOTE: The opinions expressed herein      |\\n  |   _/      _/           |   are mine, and do not reflect the opinions   |\\n  |  _/        _/          |or policies of Motorola Inc. or its affiliates.|\\n  ~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                 _/_/_/\\n',\n",

If it's a choice\\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\\nthe dog first.\\n\\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\\nhas hostile intent.\\n\\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\\n\\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\\nmotorcycle is capable of.\\n\\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\\n\\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\\n\\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\\npunishment.\\n\\nThe interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great\\ndeal to them.  The more effective you are at communicating body language, the\\nless you actually have to do.  After 7 years with my 93 pound beast, I've\\nlearned a few tricks I think...\\n\",\n",

Dog attack!\\nReply-To: ryan_cousineau@compdyn.questor.org (Ryan Cousineau) \\nDistribution: world\\nOrganization: Computer Dynamics-Vancouver B.C.-(604)986-9937 (604)255-9937\\nLines: 59\\n\\nMy previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or\\nsomething. I\\'ve weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog\\'s triangulation of target,\\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\\ndidn\\'t work because I didn\\'t have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\\nharm.\\n\\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\\nmoment is hazy.\\n\\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\\nSo I\\'m left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\\n\\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\\nhere, as I didn\\'t feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\\n\\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don\\'t think I could have\\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\\n\\nI eagerly await comment.\\n\\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\\nDoD# 0863      |I\\'d be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He\\'s hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I\\'m a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\\n                                                                                       \\n----\\n+===============================================================+\\n|COMPUTER DYNAMICS BBS    604-255-9937(HST)    604-986-9937(V32)|\\n|Vancouver, BC, Canada -  Easy Access, Low Rates, Friendly Sysop|\\n+===============================================================+\\n',\n",

Also the parent from single\\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\\n: by your arguement, die.\\n\\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\\n: \\n: |> But it gets worse.

But wait, there\\'s\\n: |> more.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |> choice that should be protected by law.

If so, fancy a date?\\n\\nHere\\'s pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you\\'ve said anything\\nor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not\\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it\\'s a merely an\\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand.

According to that beautiful line,\\nthose two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be\\nable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.

Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?\\n\\nYou can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, \"The\\nHungry Hiker\\'s Guide to Good Food,\" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source\\nis a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it\\'s a vertical wooden box with\\nventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air\\nto flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are\\nspaced every 6\" starting about 10\" above the bulb.\\n\\nOr, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use\\nyour oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may\\nnot have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or\\nracks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my\\noven - if yours goes down to 120 that\\'s probably even better.)  Stick a\\nwooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close\\nthe door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows\\nfor airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it\\noften, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are\\nusing cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway\\nthrough.\\n\\nIf you want more info, e-mail me since this isn\\'t really the right sub\\nfor this stuff.\\n\\ngerald.belton@ozonehole.com\\n\\n\\n * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.\\n                       \\n----\\nThe Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142\\n3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files\\nSKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups\\nPlease route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com\\n',\n",

But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.

But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\\n',\n",

I've seen Gravis\\njoysticks at Radio Shack.  They seemed flimsy and didn't fit well in my\\nhand.  I have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they don't last well (less than\\na year) on flightsims.  One redeeming feature does seem to be the ability\\nto adjust the tension of the stick.\\n\\nI recently purchased a CH Flightstick.  There aren't any suction cups and\\nno tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick. \\nI'm currently using it for the Wing Commander series and Red Baron.  Works\\nquite well.  The large base does not require a steadying hand and so\\nleaves it free.  The buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear\\nand feel them well).  There are other models made by CH that can go up or\\ndown in features.\\n\\nFor price comparison Gravis analogue joysticks sell for ~$35.00 here\\ncompared to the $45.00 I paid for a CH Flightstick.  I think the extra\\n$10.00 is worth it just in feel.  Best thing to do is to ask a salesperson\\nto let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.\\n\\nJust another note, analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something\\nthat needs sensitive touch.  If you're only playing games such as Castle\\nWolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up,\\ndown, left, etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into\\na Gravis gamepad.

Installing second IDE drive\\nOrganization: SURAnet, College Park, MD, USA, NA, Earth, Milky Way\\nLines: 44\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: azathoth.sura.net\\n\\nRecently my cousin got a second internal IDE drive (a Seagate 210MB,\\nI can look up the model number if it\\'s important) and I\\'ve been\\ntrying to help him install it.  [I\\'ve got a vested interest, since\\nmy machine\\'s busted and I have to use his until I get mine fixed.]\\nHe already has a Seagate 85MB IDE HD (again, I forget the model number\\nbut I can find out.)\\n\\nAnyway, I can\\'t seem to get the bloody thing up.  I\\'ve managed to get\\none or the other drive up (with the other disconnected), but not both\\nat the same time; whenever I try, the thing hangs during bootup -\\nnever gets past the system test.  The IDE controller\\'s instruction\\nsheet says it supports two drives; I think I\\'ve configured the CMOS\\ncorrectly; the power\\'s plugged in properly; I even learned about the\\nmaster/slave relationship that two HDs are supposed to have (didn\\'t\\nknow PCs were into S&M! 8^) and I think I configured the jumpers\\nproperly (the 85MB one is the master, the new 210MB one is the slave).\\n\\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe I\\'m doing the cabling wrong.  I\\'ve\\ntried several combinations:\\n\\ncontroller - master - slave\\ncontroller - slave - master\\nmaster - controller - slave\\n\\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can\\'t think of any others.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \"C: drive\" and \"D:\\ndrive\" setup info rather than \"drive 1\" and \"drive 2\" like most others\\nI\\'ve seen.  Could this be confusing things?\\n\\nSo, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it\\'s one\\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\\n\\nMany, many thanks in advance!

When I asked, people said that the\\ninterpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more\\ncomplicated.\\n\\nAnyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the \"effective\"\\nsampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency\\nantialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\\nfiltering.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t---Joel Kolstad\\n',\n",

Suppose\\nfurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by any\\nnation or group of nations.

But\\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \\nof non-interference.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate.

Sure the amp runs very fairly\\n: >  hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.\\n\\n: An amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.\\n: The amp you have probably is running Class-A the whole day.\\n\\n: Actually, I'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though\\n: the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive \\n: heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component\\n: regardless of quality.  In fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is\\n: because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted\\n: to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  Hmmmmm....\\n\\nSure, I didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the\\n  amp sounds good.  My Adcom GFP 535II runs fairly warm - not hot to\\n  the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.\\nI don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  It makes one think that\\n  the amp is doing nothing :)\\nThe heatsinks that Adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for\\n  skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below\\n  and above.  More than enough to carry away excessive heat.\\n\\nMy opinions once again.\\n\\n--\\n***********************************************************************\\n**    Alan Webber                                                    **\\n**                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          **\\n**                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          **\\n**                                                                   **\\n** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  **\\n** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          **\\n** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             **\\n** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    **\\n***********************************************************************\\n\",\n",

Even when the\\ncomfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously\\ndegrade the effectiveness of a helmet.

The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many\\nfossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were\\nadopted (\"why those old dirt burners can\\'t harm anything, let \\'em go.\").  \\n3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally\\nnot visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil\\nplants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.\\n\\n>       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual \\n>boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There\\'s a gripe in the industry\\n>that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it\\'s\\n>more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system\\n>as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.  \\n\\n>       Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they\\n>usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the\\n>way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water,\\n>rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about \"thermal \\n>pollution\" de-icing a river, said, \"Up here, we view heat as a resource\".  \\n\\nActually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants\\nof similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the \\nheat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in\\norder to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is\\nnormally water\\'s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is\\ndesirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because \\nmoisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine \\nlow pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity\\ncauses erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest\\npressure condensing environment is always the best.  \\n\\nA related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where\\nthe water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the\\ncondenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the \\ncondensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too \\nhot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into\\nsteam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a\\nparticularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all\\ncosts.  \\n\\nThe hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant\\nin order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower \\nthey must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in\\nthe hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 \\ndegrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is\\nused to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower\\nsystem is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water\\nis pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer,\\noperators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order \\nto provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher\\nhotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the\\ncondenser area.\\n\\nAt least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the\\nair :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge\\nwater from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water\\nfrom the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and\\nhumidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water\\ntemperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical\\n\"95-95\" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East.\\nIt is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful\\nin clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the\\nplant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets\\ntoo high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive\\npressure.\\n\\n>       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.

There is no much of\\nopinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader Stacker 3.0.\\n(Superstor Pro is not considered since it is slower than Stacker although\\njust as reliable - BYTE Magazine\\'s conclusion ;-) ), so it\\'s hard to make\\nany decision to go with Stacker or with DoubleDisk Gold v6.0. \\nHowever, it seems that at $39.95, it is quite a buy.\\n\\nBuddy Christyono\\nbuddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nsummary of replies\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHello Buddy,\\n\\nI do not have DD Gold 6.0 experience.  I just ordered it.  I currently have\\nDD 2.3 (the last version).  I am very pleased with its performance.\\n\\nHere is my suggestion...\\n\\n1)  If you do not have any compression software currently, I would go with\\n\\tDOS 6.0\\'s compression.  All the discussion on the net indicates that\\n\\tfor $50 you get the compression (built into the OS), plus the other\\n\\tutilities that you would pay way more than $50 for.  Besides, you \\n\\tare now at DOS6.0 (whatever that means...)\\n\\n2)  If you have DoubleDisk 2.3 already (like I do), the cost is $29.95\\n\\tfor the upgrade.  After thinking about it and asking the net, I\\n\\tdecided that I could not go wrong with the update cost!\\n\\tI have never suffered from performance of DD.  I have a 12ms HD with\\n\\tlarge SW packages in both compressed and uncompressed format.  It\\n\\tworks great.  Not delays.  I think the \"A\" is better than \"B\" \\n\\targuements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.\\n\\tI am looking forward to being able to \"LOADHIGH\" the DD sw.  That\\n\\thas been an annoyance.\\n\\n3)  If you have Stacker, et.al. currently, I would not see it worth the\\n\\teffort to upgrade.\\n\\nJust my $.02 ...\\n\\nRegards,\\nMark Bagdy\\n----------------------------------------------------------------\\nBuddy,\\n\\nI got the same mailer. About 2 weeks ago I got DDG and installed it. The\\ndocumentation was, in my opinion, easy to follow. I used the automatic\\ninstallation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.\\n\\nThere were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max\\n& QEMM. DDG has an uninstall (unlike DOS6.0) if you need it. My system has a\\n203Mb hard drive. before installing DDG I had ~5Mb free. After DDG I had\\n~197Mb free. Pretty good statistics considering that my 8Mb permanent windows\\nswap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and\\nsuch).\\n\\nI have had no problems whatsoever. I have noticed no slowdown (other than it\\ntakes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. So far I am a very\\nhappy camper.\\n\\n-Bruce\\n-- \\n  Bruce F.

It was very easy to install.\\nThe only problem I had was with Castle Wolfenstein 3-D.  I assumed the game\\nwas trying to bypass DOS disk access and moved the game to the non-compressed\\nregion of the disk.

OK ?\\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \\n         conventional. And if you\\'ve already visited any condensation-\\n         powerstation you\\'l have seen the cooling towers too.\\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\\'ll find\\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\\'ve an\\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \\n         side and need to cool down the steam \\'till you get water\\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \\n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\\n         steam on the other side you\\'ll loose much more of the energy.\\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\\n         energy that carnot will give them.\\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\\n         The vapor you\\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\\n         \\n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\\'ll have lot\\'s of problems with\\n         the boiler\\'s steel. That\\'s because at this temperature the\\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\\n         This is only for BWR\\'s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \\n\\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\\'t be 0.75 mRem\\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\\'ll still have\\n         1.5 mRem.

In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean\\nan \"air core resonant transformer\". The TV flyback version Tesla\\ncoil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for\\ndiagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called\\n\"Oscillating Shuttle Circuit\" (OSC). Generally OSC\\'s are highly\\nefficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors,\\nwhich are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active\\nreactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve\\nefficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core\\nresonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI\\nfor wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer\\nscreen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil\\nfrom it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all\\nTesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter\\nand die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind\\nto a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat,\\ngas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and\\ntelegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????\\n\\nGET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE\\nTODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA.

Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot\\nfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is\\nnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective\\nclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,\\nyou are likely to be less severely injured.\\n\\nFirst thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,\\nthis will get you started on the right foot -- they teach\\ncontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.\\n\\nSecond, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet\\nand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy \\npiece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking\\nboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine\\nfor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay \\ntied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps\\nare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the\\npants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,\\npreferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for\\na jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though\\nmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another\\nthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand\\nleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.\\n\\nThird don\\'t do anything stupid -- don\\'t ride after \\ndrinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement\\nand balance; don\\'t ride in the snow, or when conditions\\nare such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding\\nin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, \\nbrake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,\\ntired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or\\notherwise not in average shape.\\n\\nWith care, you should be ok.\\n\\n>The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for\\n>a first time rider.

It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\\n\\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\\ntube qualities?\\n\\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\\n\\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \\nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\\n\\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\\n\\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\\n\\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

It does not\\n>depend on there being false witnesses.  How could it?  The state\\n>does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes\\n\\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\\n\\n>>It is possible.  So, what are you trying to say, that capital punishment\\n>>is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating\\n>>the system?\\n>I\\'m saying capital punishment is murder, period.  Not because of\\n>this that and the other, but because it involves taking human life.\\n>That\\'s *my* definition of murder.  I make no appeals to dictionaries\\n>or to \"objective\" morals.\\n\\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\\n\\n>If we, as a society, decide to murder someone, then we should say\\n>that, and lists our reasons for doing so, and live with the moral\\n>consequences.

Society accepts the risk that an\\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people\\'s definitions of murder\\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\\nexecution, is it?\\n\\n>>But, we were trying to discuss an objective moral system, or at least its\\n>>possibilty.

Your claim, which I have quoted\\n>above is a claim about whether we can *know* it was fair, so as to\\n>be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder.\\n\\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\\npossible information), we can\\'t always determine the difference in our\\nflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,\\nbut it still isn\\'t objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn\\'t matter if\\nwe *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.\\n\\n>Now there\\'s a huge difference.  If we can read minds, we can know,\\n>and if we cannot read minds, we can know nothing.

We simply don\\'t know.\\n\\nBut, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.\\nAnd, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a\\ntotally ideal and objective system.\\n\\n>Now what are we going to do?
